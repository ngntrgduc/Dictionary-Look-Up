Extension to look up words **painlessly**.

## Why this ?

I'm so tired when looking up some words: Open a new tab -> Type dictionary web page -> Hit `Enter` -> Type a word to look up -> Hit `Enter`.

This extension will make the look up process less painful because you just need to toggle the extension and look up the word.

## Features

- Support dictionaries: [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).
- Easily toggle extension via `Alt` + `O` (default).
- Open dictionary in a new tab after press `Enter` in the search box.
- Look up word in all dictionaries by press `Alt` + `Enter` in the search box.
- Easily change dictionary via `Tab` key.
- Get previous word when press `↑` key.
- **Simple** but yet **powerful**.
