# Dictionary-Look-Up

Extension to look up words **painlessly**.

## Why this ?

I'm so tired when looking up some words: Open a new tab -> Type Dictionary webpage -> Hit `Enter` -> Type a word to look up -> Hit `Enter`.

This extension will make the look up process less painful when you just need to toggle the extension and search the word.

## Features

- Support dictionaries: [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/).
- Open dictionary in a new tab after press `Enter` in the search box.
- Easily change dictionary to look up.
- Simple but yet powerful.

## How to use
1. Clone this repository or [download zip](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your local machine.

```git
git clone https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up.git
```

2. Load extension:

- **Chrome:**  `Settings` -> `Extensions` -> Turn on `Developer mode` -> Press `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

- **Edge:**  `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions` -> Turn on `Developer mode` -> Press `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

3. Make the extension more visible by `Pin` (Chrome) / `Show in toolbar` (Edge). And create a shortcut to toggle the extension easier in `Keyboard shortcuts` (I use `Alt + O`).

4. Enjoy your brand new look up process âœ¨. If you want to change dictionary, use `Tab` key and arrow
 keys to change and `Shift + Tab` to go back to the search box.
