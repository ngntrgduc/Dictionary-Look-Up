Extension to look up words **painlessly**.

## Why this ?

I'm so tired when looking up some words: Open a new tab -> Type dictionary web page -> Hit `Enter` -> Type a word to look up -> Hit `Enter`.

This extension will make the look up process less painful because you just need to toggle the extension and look up the word.

## Features

- Support dictionaries: [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- Easily toggle extension via `Alt` + `O` (default)
- Open dictionary in a new tab after press `Enter` in the search box
- Easily change dictionary via `Tab` key
- Get previous word when press `â†‘` key
- Search multiple word at once, using `,` (default)
- **Simple** but yet **powerful**

## Installation
**Note**: If you use Firefox, please go to [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dictionary-look-up/), or you can checkout [`firefox` branch](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/tree/firefox).

1. Clone this repository / [download zip](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your local machine.

```git
git clone https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up.git
```

2. Load extension:

- **Chrome:**  `Settings` -> `Extensions`.
- **Edge:**    `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions`.

Then turn on `Developer mode`. Finally, click `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

3. 
   - Make the extension more visible by `Pin` (Chrome)/`Show in toolbar` (Edge). 
   - Change shortcut in `Keyboard shortcuts` if needed.
   - If you want to change default dictionary, go to the source code folder and change order of option in [index.html](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/blob/master/index.html#L15-L17).

4. Enjoy your brand new look up process âœ¨. 

## Todo
- [ ] Options page
  - [ ]  Select default dictionary (change order of url)
  - [ ]  Custom url to search (general purpose, like search video on Youtube, not only for dictionary)
  - [ ] Custom seperator...
- [x]  Search multiple word at once, using seperator (`,`) ~~(user defined)~~ (maybe keep the extension/add-on simple)
- [ ]  ~~Right click to look up word (does it necessary or just a make the extension slower ?)~~ (typing vocab to look up is faster, and make it more memorable)
- [ ] ~~Auto read copied text when open the extension (no more Ctrl + V)~~ (the JS clipboard API is [limited availability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API#browser_compatibility))
- [x] Change behavior of `Tab` key because clicking to change dictionary seem weird when it's just switch to other but not show the dictionary pane
- [ ] Another port
  - [ ] ~~Chrome~~ (because it's cost 5$ fee to create account ðŸ¥²)
  - [ ] Edge
- [ ] Recently, the autofocus to input box not working in Firefox, maybe switch to pure HTML/CSS?
- [ ] ~~If search incorrect vocab, auto redirect to the search page with vocab (for Cambridge dictionary)~~ (too specific, and type again make vocab more memorable)
- [ ] ~~`Shift` + `Tab` to move back dictionary~~ (open the select menu is better)
  - [x] Change/Fix/Remove focus behavior, maybe using event.key instead
- [x] Remove and maybe add new feature for `Alt` + `Tab` instead. Because open all dictionaries for word is not neccessary, and maybe upgrade this extension to be more general (like vomnibar in Vimium), not only with dictionary look up
