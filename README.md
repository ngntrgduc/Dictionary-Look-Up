# Oxford-Dictionary-Look-Up
Chrome extension to look up words in [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/).
## Why this ?
I'm so tired when looking up some words: Open a new tab -> Type Oxford Dictionary webpage -> Hit `Enter` -> Type a word to look up -> Hit `Enter`. 

This extension will make the look up process less painful when you just need to toggle the extension and search the word.

## Features
- Look up at Oxford Dictionary - The largest and most trusted free online dictionary for learners.
- Open Oxford Dictionary in a new tab after press `Enter` in the search box.
- Simple but yet powerful. 

## How to use
1. Clone this repository or [download zip](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Oxford-Dictionary-Look-Up/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your local machine.
```git
git clone https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Oxford-Dictionary-Look-Up.git
``` 

2. Load extension:
- **Chrome:** `Settings` -> `Extensions` -> Turn on `Developer mode` -> Press `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.
- **Edge:** `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions` -> Turn on `Developer mode` -> Press `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.
3. Make the extension more visible by `Pin` (Chrome) / `Show in toolbar` (Edge). And create a shortcut to toggle the extension easier in `Keyboard shortcuts` (I use `Alt + O`).
4. Enjoy your brand new look up process.
