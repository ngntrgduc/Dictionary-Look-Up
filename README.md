Extension to look up words **painlessly**.

## Why this ?

I'm so tired when looking up some words: Open a new tab -> Type dictionary web page -> Hit `Enter` -> Type a word to look up -> Hit `Enter`.

This extension will make the look up process less painful when you just need to toggle the extension and search the word.

## Features

- Support dictionaries: [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).
- Open dictionary in a new tab after press `Enter` in the search box.
- Look up word in all dictionaries by press `Alt` + `Enter` in the search box.
- Easily change dictionary via `Tab` key.
- Get previous word when press `↑` key.
- **Simple** but yet **powerful**.

## How to use
1. Clone this repository / [download zip](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your local machine.

```git
git clone https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up.git
```

2. Load extension:

- **Chrome:**  `Settings` -> `Extensions`.
- **Edge:**  `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions`.

Then turn on `Developer mode`. Finally, click `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

3. 
   - Make the extension more visible by `Pin` (Chrome) / `Show in toolbar` (Edge). 
   - Create a shortcut to toggle the extension easier in `Keyboard shortcuts` (I use `Alt` + `O`>).
   - If you want to change default dictionary, go to the source code folder and change order of option in [index.html](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/blob/master/index.html).

4. Enjoy your brand new look up process ✨.
