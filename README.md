Extension to look up words **painlessly**.

## Why this ?

I'm so tired when looking up some words: Open a new tab -> Type dictionary web page -> Hit `Enter` -> Type a word to look up -> Hit `Enter`.

This extension will make the look up process less painful because you just need to toggle the extension and look up the word.

## Features

- Support dictionaries: [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).
- Easily toggle extension via `Alt` + `O` (default).
- Open dictionary in a new tab after press `Enter` in the search box.
- Look up word in all dictionaries by press `Alt` + `Enter` in the search box.
- Easily change dictionary via `Tab` key.
- Get previous word when press `â†‘` key.
- Search multiple word at once, using comma (`,`)
- Select word and **right-click to look up**.
- **Simple** but yet **powerful**.

2. Load extension:

Then turn on `Developer mode`. Finally, click `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

   - Change shortcut in `Keyboard shortcuts` if needed.
   - If you want to change default dictionary, go to the source code folder and change order of option in [index.html](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Dictionary-Look-Up/blob/master/index.html#L15-L17).

4. Enjoy your brand new look up process âœ¨. 

## Todo
- [ ] Options page
  - [ ]  Select default dictionary (change order of url)
  - [ ]  Custom url to search (general purpose, like search video on Youtube, not only for dictionary)
  - [x]  Search multiple word at once, using seperator (`,`) ~~(user defined)~~ (maybe keep the extension/add-on simple)
- [ ]  Right click to look up word (does it necessary or just a make the extension slower ?)
- [ ] Auto read copied text when open the extension (no more Ctrl + V)
- [ ] Change behavior of `Tab` key because clicking to change dictionary seem weird when it's just switch to other but not show the dictionary pane
- [ ] Another port
  - [ ] ~~Chrome~~ (because it's cost 5$ fee to create account ðŸ¥²)
  - [ ] Edge
