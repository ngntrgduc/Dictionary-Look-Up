# Dictionary-Look-Up
Extension to look up words **painlessly**.

![](/images/dlu.png)

## Why this ?
I'm so tired when looking up some words: 
1. Open a new tab 
2. Type dictionary web page 
3. Hit `Enter` 
4. Type a word to look up 
5. Hit `Enter`

This extension will make the look up process less painful because you just need to toggle the extension and look up the word.


## Features
- Support dictionaries: [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/), [Oxford](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/), [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- Easily toggle extension via shortcut `Alt + O` (default)
- Easily change dictionary via `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` key
- Get previously looked up word when press `↑` arrow key
- Search multiple words at once, separated by a comma (`,`)
- Prevent searching for mistyped words that contain invalid characters, symbols, and numbers
- **Simple** but yet **powerful**, **time-saving**
